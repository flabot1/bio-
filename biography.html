        <p>Flavia Spasari, aka flaVsia on sound works, (2000) was born in Calabria and then splitted as she grew up in three other regions. She graduated at the Academy of Fine Arts in Carrara in Visual Arts and Sculpture and currently lives and works in Venice while attending the Master of Visual Arts at the IUAV in Venice.</p>

        <p>Sound and field recordings within her production represent the glue of all her research and, through a constant process of mixing different languages, she seeks interrelations in the sphere of the sensible. The interest in sound, and listening in particular, accompanies her thinking in theoretical and practical research and in her latest works of installations, performances and sound compositions, which have intrinsic the elements of iteration, fragmentation and how these are tools for the construction of perceived reality in the sensible.</p>
